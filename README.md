## Project 7: Build a tip calculator.

###### **Goal:** Be able to input the meal cost, select the desired tip percentage, and display the tip amount and total using forms

This project serves as a tip calculator, allowing the user to calculate the amount to tip based on four common tip percentages.

**Technologies used:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS

The challenge for this project was applying my first use of querySelector on the checked value and navigating the different types of forms offered. Properly labeling each input and understanding the reason for each attribute was one of the key learning points for me.
