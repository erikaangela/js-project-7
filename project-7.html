<!-- Project 7: Build a tip calculator.

Math Hint:
tip amount = Bill amount x (tip percentage / 100)

Requirements:
-Create a Github repository for this project.
-You should have a form where a user is able to input the cost of the meal.
-The form should also let the user choose the percentage tip they want to give.
-When they submit the form, show them the total with tip added.
-Display the total tip amount as well so they know how much they're tipping.
-Send me the project for review and get started on the next project. -->
